**Challenge:** Through the Radar Looking Glass: Revealing Earth Processes with SAR

**Team/Individual:** Yasaswini Chebolu

**Project Title:** Through the Radar Looking Glass: Reykjanes Volcano SAR Analysis

## Project Summary (3-4 sentences)

This project analyzes multi-polarization Sentinel-1 SAR data over Iceland's Reykjanes Peninsula to detect volcanic surface changes during the 2024-2025 eruption series. Using VV and VH polarization data, we computed VH/VV ratios to classify surface types and detect temporal changes. The analysis revealed localized surface modifications corresponding to known eruption events, demonstrating SAR's all-weather capability for volcano monitoring. Results are presented through an interactive web map and Alice in Wonderland-themed narrative.

## Deliverables

- Interactive web map with multi-temporal SAR layers
- Scientific narrative (Alice in Wonderland theme)
- 7-slide presentation
- Change detection maps and statistics
- Complete analysis code (Python)

## Technology Stack

- Python (rasterio, matplotlib, folium)
- Sentinel-1 SAR data (ASF/Copernicus)
- ASF HyP3 cloud processing
- GitHub for version control

## Key Innovations

1. Multi-polarization ratio analysis for surface classification
2. Interactive web visualization with eruption timeline integration
3. Creative science communication (Alice theme)
4. Reproducible cloud-based processing workflow
